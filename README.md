## Technical exercise - Data Science lead \@ Giskard

This repository contains the technical exercise required as part of Giskard's recruitment process. The exercise includes the following items:

-   **Creation of a Python model for text generation, and evaluation via Giskard's Python library along with use of Giskard's server.** This corresponds to "Requirements 1 and 2" of the original technical exercise link. This part of the requirements is addressed in the file "AI-Audit-Report-Question-Answering.html". I've opted for the creation and evaluation of a language model that answers questions about the latest trends in third-party AI audits based on a 2023 report by the Regulatory Governance Initiative (you can find the report among the files in this repository). To view the final notebook along with the outputs, please download the "AI-Audit-Report-Question-Answering.html" file and open it with your browser of choice.

-   **Creation of piece of content to explain the value of Giskard.** This corresponds to "Requirement 3" of the original technical exercise link. I opted for a blog post created with Quarto. To view the blog post, please download the file named "the-value-of-giskard.html" and open it with your browser of choice.

-   **Discussion of what could be improved in Giskard's product.** This corresponds to "Requirement 4" of the original technical exercise link. I generally enjoyed using Giskard and reading the documentation, so I can only share a few thoughts regarding potential room of improvement, rather than flaws. My comments are included in the file "feedback".

Thank you for your time for checking my exercise 😊.

Best regards,

Davide Gentile
